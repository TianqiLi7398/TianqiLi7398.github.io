I'm a PhD student doing research in Multi-agent robotic system in [CAST](https://cast.tamu.edu/) lab advised by Dr. [Swaminathan Gopalswamy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/gopalswamy-s.html). 

My research interest is about the coordination of robots in motion planning and sensor fusion.
