# Teaching

- MEEN 364 Dynamic System Feedback: This is an undergraduate core course of control knowledge. I TAed this course in 2019 spring in lab sessions, which contianed knowledge of MatLab/Simulink of linear system in mechanical, electric and hydraulic setups.
- MEEN 260 Mechanical Measurements: This is an unergraduate course about data collection from hardwares. I TAed this course in 2019 spring in lab sessions, which contained knowledge of data collection of physical systems by LabView.
