## Personal Website

Welcome! This is my personal website which shows my research, life and opinions to the world as a window. My profiles, news will be slowly updated in this web. A news in near future will be that I'll attend and chair the session _Heterogeneous Multiagent Autonomous Systems_ in 2021 [CCTA](https://ccta2021.ieeecss.org/) this Auguest! Hope there will be inspiring discussions happening.
