I'm a research scientist at Meta since 2024.

My PhD is about multi-agent robotic system in [CAST](https://cast.tamu.edu/) lab advised by Dr. [Swaminathan Gopalswamy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/gopalswamy-s.html). 

My research interest is about agent interaction, robotic motion planning and sensor fusion.

## Status

I'm on the job market currently with research & career interest
includes:
- Algorithms: foundational AI models, embodied learning, reinforcement learning (RL), game theory, Dynamic Programming (DP)
- AI agent design, interaction.
- Applications in self-driving, networked robot system, active sensing, agricultural robotics
