I'm a final year PhD candidate doing research in multi-agent robotic system in [CAST](https://cast.tamu.edu/) lab advised by Dr. [Swaminathan Gopalswamy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/gopalswamy-s.html). 

My research interest is about the coordination of robots in motion planning and sensor fusion.

## Status

As I'm wrapping up my thesis and preparing finishing my thesis, I'm on the job market currently. My research & career interest
includes:
- Algorithms: Markov Decision Process (MDP), reinforcement learning (RL), game theory, Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Coordination, target tracking/estimation and sensor fusion in the multi-robot systems
- Applications in self-driving, networked robot system, active sensing, agricultural robotics
